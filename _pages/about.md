I am an adjunct professor at the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html">University of Alberta</a>. My research interests lie broadly in machine learning, specifically in (deep) reinforcement learning, representation learning, continual learning, and real-world applications of all the above. I am also an <a href="https://www.amii.ca/">Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii)</a> Fellow, a Canada <a href="https://cifar.ca/">CIFAR</a> AI Chair through Amii, and a principal investigator in the <a href="http://rlai.ualberta.ca/">Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Intelligence (RLAI)</a> group. I completed my B.Sc. and M.Sc. at <a href="https://ufmg.br/">UFMG</a>, Brazil, and my Ph.D. at the <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html">University of Alberta</a>. During my Ph.D., among other things, I popularized the idea of temporally-extended exploration through options, introducing the idea of eigenoptions. I was a researcher at <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/">DeepMind</a> and at <a href="https://research.google/teams/brain/">Google Brain<a> for four years; during which time I made several contributions to reinforcement learning, including the application of deep reinforcement learning to control Loonâ€™s stratospheric balloons, published in Nature. My research has been featured in popular media such as <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210222-how-googles-hot-air-balloon-surprised-its-creators">BBC</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2018-05-23/hello-world-canada-the-rise-of-ai-video">Bloomberg TV</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21811123/alphabet-loon-internet-balloons-ai-machine-learning-pilot">The Verge</a>, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/new-ai-based-navigation-helps-loons-balloons-hover-in-place/">Wired</a>.
